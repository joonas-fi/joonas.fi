Unfortunately, redirecting to `m.` prefix for mobile browsers is quite popular. The downside of this is that when people share a link to the content, and if another person follows the link on a desktop or a laptop, the view is horrible:

If you want to use separate domain for mobile, at the very least make sure the "desktop" link takes you to the same content:

After clicking it, it only takes me to the frontpage of the website:

Even though I was reading a very specific article with very specific URL, they decided to lose the context. The "facepalm" frontpage picture is very apt, though. :)

I was able to read the article in desktop view by removing `m.` prefix from the URL, but how is a non-techie supposed to realize that?

Usability grade: F.
